            <h2>Coding Using the Unknown</h2>
            <p class="justified-text"> In my previous school, we were only taught to code using Python and Tinkercad for the robotics subject. Exploring, self-learning, and coding using GitHub, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are first for me, which lead to difficulties in the beginning because I have no prior knowledge. However, as I continue to get the gist of it and know what code to input, I slowly start to once again feel the joy and excitement when I started coding for the first time and accomplishing the appearance and idea I thought of in my mind. I enjoy coding not just because it's a part of technology and mostly a part of my life due to my interests and hobbies, but it's like playing a puzzle game; you never know what piece fits together, so you do trial and error, and when you finally achieve the final results, it feels like you accomplished something great. </p>

            <h2>Promoting Computer Science</h2>
            <p class="justified-text"> Promoting on social media is common nowadays for the reason that people use the internet every single day. Which is why knowing how to properly promote something is very crucial in today's world. It is no surprise that mostly all students, including me, have basic knowledge when it comes to this because of school projects and activities. Experiencing this once again taught me how to be more creative and change how I speak and act to gain the attention of others.</p>

            <h2>Serving Others</h2>
            <p class="justified-text"> After the pandemic, I quite became an introvert due to the lack of social interaction with other people who I am not familiar with. This simple usher task given to us gave me the chance to let my voice out even if it's just a small conversation. It gave me a push to try to interact with other people and not be nervous or embarrass because talking is normal in a society or community.</p>
